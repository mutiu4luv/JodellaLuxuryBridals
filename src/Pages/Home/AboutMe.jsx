            She started investing in crypto in late 2009. The more I learnt
            about the technology that crypto is built on top of (blockchain),
            the more I began to understand what profound impact this new
            technology would have on the world. From my hands on experience
            using crypto, needing to use exchanges, setting up my own personal
            wallets and more.
            {/* I
            learnt that I could help others get started with crypto so at the
            start of 2013 I began teaching crypto and have really enjoyed being
            able to help my students understand more about crypto and develop
            their skills. I look forward to teaching many more students so
            whether you just want help getting started or you need help with
            more advanced crypto tasks, don't hesitate to book a lesson. */}
